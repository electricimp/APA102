# APA102 Class

This class allows the Electric Imp to drive APA102 LEDs. The APA102 is an all-in-one RGB LED with integrated shift register and constant-current driver. The parts are daisy-chained and are controlled over a two-wire SPI protocol. Each pixel is individually addressable and this allows the part to be used for a wide range of animation effects.

One example of the APA102 hardware in use is the [Adafruit DotStar](http://www.adafruit.com/categories/340), which comes in strip and chip forms.

## Hardware

APA102s require a 5V power supply and logic, and each pixel can draw up to 60mA when displaying white in full brightness, so be sure to size your power supply appropriately. Undersized power supplies (lower voltages and/or insufficent current) can cause glitches and/or failure to produce and light at all.

Because APA102s require 5V for clock and logic, you will need to shift both of these Imp outputs from 3.3V to 5V.

## Class Usage

All public methods in the APA102 class return `this`, allowing you to easily chain multiple commands together:

```squirrel
pixels
    .set(0, [255,0,0])
    .set(1, [0,255,0])
    .fill([0,0,255], 2, 4)
    .draw();
```

### constructor(spiBus, numPixels [, draw])

Instantiate the class with a pre-configured SPI object and the number of pixels that are connected. The SPI object can be configured at any clock speed but must have the *SIMPLEX_TX* flag set:

```squirrel
#require "APA102.class.nut:1.0.0"

// Configure the SPI bus
spi <- hardware.spi257;
spi.configure(SIMPLEX_TX, 7500);

// Instantiate LED array with 5 pixels
pixels <- APA102(spi, 5);
```

An optional third parameter can be set to control whether the class will draw an empty frame on initialization. The default value is `true`.

### set(*index, color*)

The *set* method changes the color of a particular pixel in the frame buffer. The color is passed as as an array of three integers between 0 and 255 representing `[red, green, blue]`.

Optionally, a fourth integer between 0 and 31 can be passed in the array to control LED brightness.  **It is highly recommended that this parameter not be used, as it dramatically reduces the LED PWM clock rate.**

NOTE: The *set* method does not output the changes to the pixel strip. After setting up the frame, you must call `draw` (see below) to output the frame to the strip.

```squirrel
// Set and draw a pixel
pixels.set(0, [127,0,0]).draw();
```

### fill(*color, [start], [end]*)

The *fill* methods sets all pixels in the specified range to the desired color. If no range is selected, the entire frame will be filled with the specified color.

NOTE: The *fill* method does not output the changes to the pixel strip. After setting up the frame, you must call `draw` (see below) to output the frame to the strip.

```squirrel
// Turn all LEDs off
pixels.fill([0,0,0]).draw();
```

```squirrel
// Set half the array red
// and the other half blue
pixels
    .fill([100,0,0], 0, 2)
    .fill([0,0,100], 3, 4);
    .draw();
```

### draw()

The *draw* method draws writes the current frame to the pixel array (see examples above).
